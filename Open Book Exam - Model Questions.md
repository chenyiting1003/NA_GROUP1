# Model Questions

## Model Question 1: Object-Oriented Design (4 points)

Drawing on the example provided in [Lecture 5.3](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/lectures/5.3-Design.html), briefly explain how inheritance works with reference to natural systems and why it is more problematic in programming.



## Model Question 2: Decorators (3 points)

Using the example from [Practical 5](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/practicals/Practical-05-Objects.html#decorating) briefly explain how decorators are a useful addition to Python.



## Model Question 3: Tuples (1 point)

Where are you likely to encounter tuples in spatial data science and why are they preferred over lists?



## Model Question 4: CLI (2 points)

How could you find the first 10 lines that contain the term `Entire home/apt` from a CSV file (e.g. `data.csv`) using the command line? Briefly explain the pros and cons of this approach over Excel.



## Model  Question 5: Errors (2 points)

Drawing on [Lecture 5.4](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/lectures/5.4-Errors.html#/4/6), briefly explain why your `try` block might be followed by multiple `except` blocks *and* a `finally` block as well.



## Model Question 6: Iteration (1 point)

Using example code to illustrate, show how iterating over a single column's values from a dataset differ if you are using a list-of-lists or a dictionary-of-lists and explain the pros and cons of each approach.
