See the raw file for examples of how to hide computational output as there is code hidden here.

```{python}

import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
#| echo: False
host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
path = '~jreades/data'
file = '20240614-London-listings.parquet'

if os.path.exists(file):
  df = pd.read_parquet(file)
else: 
  df = pd.read_parquet(f'{host}/{path}/{file}')

## 1. Who collected the InsideAirbnb data?

The data on the Inside Airbnb website comes from publicly available information on the Airbnb website. 
It has been analyzed, cleaned and aggregated for public discussion. 
https://insideairbnb.com/

There are many people who have contributed to this. 
Murray Cox uses data, media, and technology for social change, and is the founder and current chief data activist at Inside Airbnb. 
John Morris is a founding collaborator on the website design and redesign and the creative producer of the project's main report. 
Tyler Higgins works to build and organize Inside Airbnb's data and activism community. 
Regarding past collaborators, Michael Ziggy Mintz is a fixture in New York City's civic and housing data community, and he worked on automating search for Airbnb. 
Anya Sophe Behn is one of the project's early collaborators, straddling technology and the arts, supporting the project's mission, stabilizing the search code, and moving the project to the cloud.

Inside Airbnb collects data to address the impact of Airbnb and similar short-term rental platforms on housing and communities. The key motivations and objectives include:

Driving Factors:

Addressing Misleading and Incomplete Data: Airbnb often downplays the role of large-scale landlords and fails to provide sufficient metrics for analyzing broader economic and social impacts.
Public Interest: Short-term rentals reduce housing availability, disrupt neighborhoods, and increase housing costs, creating the need for independent data to uncover these effects.

Objectives:

Increase Transparency: Highlight inaccuracies and omissions in Airbnb's official reports to provide a clearer understanding of short-term rental impacts.
Support Policy Development: Offer actionable data to governments and communities to help regulate short-term rentals effectively.
Promote Public Discourse: Empower activists, policymakers, scholars, and communities to better understand and discuss the impact of Airbnb on housing and neighborhoods.
The project aims to advocate for sustainable housing policies, empower local communities, and support housing activists, journalists, and researchers in addressing challenges posed by short-term rentals.

## 2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data?

:::

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(f"One of way to embed output in the text looks like this: after cleaning, we were left with {df.shape[0]:,} rows of data.")
```

This way is also supposed to work (`{python} f"{df.shape[0]:,}"`) but I've found it less reliable.

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the InsideAirbnb data collected?

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of the InsideAirbnb data set's representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of the InsideAirbnb data raise?

## 6. With reference to the InsideAirbnb data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London?

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (*e.g.* figures, maps, EDA/ESDA, and simple statistical analysis/models drawing on experience from, e.g., CASA0007), how *could* the InsideAirbnb data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?

## Sustainable Authorship Tools

Using the Terminal in Docker, you compile the Quarto report using `quarto render <group_submission_file>.qmd`.

Your QMD file should automatically download your BibTeX and CLS files and any other required files. If this is done right after library loading then the entire report should output successfully.

Written in Markdown and generated from [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Fonts used: [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) (mainfont), [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) ([sansfont]{style="font-family:Sans-Serif;"}) and [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains%20Mono) (`monofont`).
